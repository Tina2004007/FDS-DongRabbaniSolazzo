# FDS Pokémon Battles Prediction 2025

This repository contains the source code for our team's submission to the "FDS: Pokemon Battles prediction 2025" Kaggle competition.

## Repository Structure (Toolbox)

This repository functions as our "Toolbox," as required by the course guidelines. The final Kaggle notebook clones this repository to import and run our models.

* `/model_v1_code.py`: Contains the class and helper functions for **Submission 1 (A/B Test: LogReg vs. Voting)**.
* `/model_v2_code.py`: Contains the class and helper functions for **Submissions 2 & 3 (Advanced Stacking Ensemble)**.
* `/submission-1.ipynb` & `/submission-2.ipynb`: The original notebooks from which the `.py` modules were extracted.
